# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Knots is pre-1.0. Security fixes are applied to the latest release and `main`.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Latest release | Yes |
| `main` branch | Best effort |
| Older releases | No |

## Reporting a vulnerability
Use a private reporting channel. Do not open public issues for suspected security issues.

Preferred channel:
1. Open a private report via GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.
2. Include reproduction steps, impact, and affected versions.

If private reporting is not yet enabled on the repository, contact maintainers directly and
request private handling before sharing details.

## Response targets
- Initial acknowledgement: within 2 business days
- Triage/update cadence: every 5 business days until resolution plan exists
- Fix publication target: as quickly as possible based on severity and exploitability

## Scope and out-of-scope
Security reports should focus on vulnerabilities that affect confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of Knots users and data.

Non-security issues (feature requests, UX bugs, refactors, minor docs fixes) should be filed
as normal GitHub issues.
