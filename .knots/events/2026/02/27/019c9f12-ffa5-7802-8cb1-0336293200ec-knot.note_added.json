    "content": "User changed direction: remove all autocomplete coloring/sectioning and use one flat alphabetical command list. Implemented by simplifying zsh post-processing to emit a single sorted commands array for _kno_commands/_kno__help_commands and one _describe call (`_describe -t commands 'kno commands' commands \"$@\"`). Removed grouped/colored markers from generated script. Updated tests accordingly (`zsh_completions_are_flat_and_unstyled`, `zsh_commands_are_sorted_alphabetically`).",
